# Helpin

Helpin is a minimalist Employee FAQ & Self-Service chatbot designed for internal HR use. This repository contains **PHASE 1**, which is a fully mocked front-end experience with no backend, no AI, and no authentication.

## Phase 1 scope

- Plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- No Firebase, no OpenAI, no backend
- All data mocked locally in `js/mockData.js`
- Deterministic responses based on the mocked knowledge base

## How to use locally

1. Open `admin.html` in your browser to configure the assistant behavior, knowledge base, and chat topics.
2. Open `chat.html` in your browser to see the employee chat experience.
3. `index.html` redirects directly to `admin.html`.

No build tools or servers are required. Opening the HTML files directly in a browser is enough.
